> ### Task
> 
> You have a model of a beautiful ancient Roman statue with 394888 triangles in it (**models/roman.ply**).
> It loads with a simple WebGL viewer based on Three.js rendering engine.
> 
> You need to implement an algorithm which heats the model in real-time in the areas closest to the mouse cursor. It should be visualized 
> with a temperature falloff in the following way: the most heated areas are red and the least ones are blue.
> 
> The temperature of the statue drops with time until it is completely cool.
> 
> You can find an example of what it should look like in the **heatmap.mp4** video.
